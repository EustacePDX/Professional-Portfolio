					<h2> College:</h2>
					<h3> - Bachelor of Science from Eckerd College</u></h3>
					<h3> - Graduated December 31, 2014 with Honors Diploma</u></h3>
					<h3> - Computer Science Major and 3.56 GPA</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p>In the fall of 2011, during my first semester of college, I took a class called Survey of Computing (CS 110M).
					This was the first computer science course I had ever taken, and it left a great impact on me. In Survey 
					of Computing I found that I had a deep passion for the field, the subjects were fascinating and the problems
					intriguing. While I found the subject was at times challenging, it was very much within my grasp given a little 
					hardwork and perseverance.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Over the following three years I took many computer courses. During sophmore year it was Data Structures (CS 221N)
					and Computer Graphics (CS 450), during which I built a <a href="Projects.htm#proj7" style="color:black;"><u>user input game</u></a> based 
					on the Java Swing libraries and <a href="Projects.htm#proj6" style="color:black;"><u>a short animation</u></a> redered in a program called Pov-Ray.</p> 
					<p></p>
					<p>I took GUI design (CS 350), Programming languages (CS 320) and Web Development (CS 331) amoung others junior year. In those classes I built
					an extension to the Java API libraries for <a href="Projects.htm#proj3" style="color:black;"><u>geometric calculations</u></a>, 
					<a href="Projects.htm#proj4" style="color:black;"><u>devolped a website</u></a> for a local community client, and created a Apple
					<a href="Projects.htm#proj5" style="color:black;"><u>iPhone application</u></a> demonstrating use of the NSTimer mechanism.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>With the help of diligence and midnight oil I was able to complete my senior year in only one semester.
					In that time I built an <a href="Projects.htm#proj2" style="color:black;"><u>additional website</u></a> for another community client (QM 410), 
					and served as a <a href="Projects.htm#proj1" style="color:black;"><u>research assistant</u></a> to my mentor, verifying calculations made using CUDA code on the GPU (CS 498).</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Additionally I completed the Eckerd College honors program while taking 
					several composition courses, a film course, and studied two forign languages, 
					Chichewa (WTI 9G) and French (FR 101/102/201/202). Extra curricularly I was involved with the Outdoor club of 
					Eckerd College my Freshman year until my professors selected me to work as a <a href="Professional-Experience.htm#work1" style="color:black;"><u>lab 
					assistant</u></a> in the Advanced Computing lab in my sophmore year, taking up that free 
					time. And as always I continued to play ice hockey in the off-season.
					<p></p>
					<p>During my time in college I learned a ton of technical knowledge that is applicable 
					to the field. More importantly though I discovered a great passion of mine and made a 
					life decision to follow it forward.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h2> High School:</h2>
					<h3> - High School Diploma from Aloha High School</h3>
					<h3> - Graduated June 16, 2011 as a Salutitorian</h3>
					<h3> - AP Scholar with Honor and 4.16 GPA</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p>In 2007 I began my high school studies. I entered high school with an advanced credit in French 1 which I had earned in middle school.
					My freshman year I earned a 4.0 GPA while takeing the advanced placement human geography course. Sophmore year I received a 3.93 while
					taking AP European history. In junior year I recieved a 3.66 and took both AP US history and AP environmental studies. And finally senior
					year I earned a 3.93 while studing AP US government and AP micro/macro economics. Taken all together and weighted to accomidate the AP courses 
					I finished high school with a 4.16 weighted GPA, 23/432 in my class and with 7 AP classes earned the AP scholar award.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>During high school I played soccer freshman and sophmore year, then was involved with the Beaverton youth peer court junior and senior year, 
					and additonally I played ice hockey.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>As a whole I found the experience of high school trying but also very rewarding. Primarily I learned the meaning of hardwork and discipline in 
					high school. The rigor and amount of work that I took on taught me the importance of preparing for tasks, following instructions carefully, and continuing 
					to work until the task is complete.</p>
