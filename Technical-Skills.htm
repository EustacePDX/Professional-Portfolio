					<h2>Technical Skills</h2>

					<h3> - Java</h3>
					<p>I began studying Java as a freshman in college (2011) and it was used prolifically throughout my 
					education in virtually all of my CS classes the following three years. Java is the programming 
					language I feel most comfortable using.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>I have participated in many projects that used Java, including creating an extension to the API
					libraries to make Euclidian <a href="Projects.htm#proj3" style="color:black;"><u>Geometric calculations</u></a> more efficient for programmers and building
					a multiclass user input based game using the <a href="Projects.htm#proj7" style="color:black;"><u>Java Swing imports</u></a>. Additionally I have professional 
					experience with the language as a <a href="Professioal-Experience.htm#work1" style="color:black;"><u>lab assistant</u></a>, paid specifically for my exemplary amd expansive 
					knowledge of the language. I would evaluate my own skills in Java as highly advanced.</p>
					<p></p>

					<h3> - HTML/CSS</h3>
					<p>I first studied HTML and CSS in Web Development (CS 331) and Programming languages (CS 320) 
					my junior year of college (2014). I feel very comfortable using both HTML and CSS.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>In addition to this website I have created two others using HTML and CSS. One for an <a href="Projects.htm#proj2" style="color:black;"><u>immunization 
					initative</u></a> and another for a <a href="Projects.htm#proj4" style="color:black;"><u>business district</u></a>. I would evaluate my own skills with HTML and CSS as advanced.</p>
					<p></p>

					<h3> - Objective-C/iOS</h3>
					<p>I studied Objective-C and iOS programming in Graphical User Interface Design (CS 350) my junior 
					year of college (2013). I feel very comfortable programming in these languages.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>With Objective-C and iOS programing I developed an <a href="Projects.htm#proj5" style="color:black;"><u>iPhone application</u></a> designed to show mastery of
					GUI design concepts with use of the NStimers mechanism. I would evaluate my own skills with Objective-C
					/iOS as advanced.</p>
					<p></p>

					<h3> - PHP/MySQL</h3>
					<p>My first experience with PHP/MySQL came in my Databases (CS 360) class my senior year of college (2014).
					I feel very comfortable programming in both PHP and MySQL.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>With my knowledge of these languages I developed a website for an <a href="Projects.htm#proj2" style="color:black;"><u>imunization initative</u></a> that utilized PHP 
					to make MySQL queries of a prototype database. I would evaluate my own skills with PHP and MySQL as advanced.</p>
					<p></p>

					<h3> - C++/CUDA</h3>
					<p>I began working with C++ and CUDA code in Programming languages (CS 320) my junior year of college (2014). 
					I feel comfortable using both these languages.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p> I used my skills in these languages in my Software Capstone course (CS 498) working as a <a href="Projects.htm#proj1" style="color:black;"><u>research assistant</u></a> to my professor
					verifying calculations made on the GPU. I would evaluate my own skills with PHP and MySQL as proficient.</p>
					<p></p>

					<h3> - Python</h3>
					<p>I studied Python programming in my Programming Languages class (CS 320) Junior year of college (2014). This is a 
					language I feel relatively comfortable using.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>On occasion students would come into to the Eckerd College Advanced Scientific Computing lab while I was 
					on call working as a lab assistant with Python questions. While my primary training for that job was in Java, Python 
					was not so different that I could not offer help. I would evaluate my own skills in Python as moderately proficient.</p>
