# Professional-Portfolio
HTML/CSS code for www.KyleKempton.com

I am trying to create a professional portfolio for people interested in hireing me to look at, in case they have the intereset. I wrote this code strictly using notepad because I wanted it to be a demonstration of my ability to write HTML/CSS code. However it was recommended to me that I post the code here, so that anyone with suggestions could comment and help me improve the site.
