					<h2>Welcome</h2>
					<p>Hello, my name is Kyle Kempton. Welcome to my professional portfolio website!</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>I am a recent honors graduate from Eckerd College with a degree in 
					computer science and a 3.56 GPA. </p>
					<p></p>
					<p>During my academic work I was involved with several projects. I acted as 
					a <a href="Projects.htm#proj1" style="color: black;"><u>research assistant</u></a> on a bioinformatics project verifying calculations of 
					fractal dimensions made on the GPU using C++ and CUDA code. I have developed 
					multiple <a href="Projects.htm#proj2" style="color:black;"><u>websites</u></a> for community clients as a way to interact with their customers 
					using HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL queries. I created an extension of the Java API 
					libraries to make Euclidean <a href="Projects.htm#proj3" style="color: black;"><u>geometric calculations</u></a> more efficient. I have written 
					an <a href="Projects.htm#proj5" style="color: black;"><u>iPhone application</u></a> in Objective C for iOS designed to show mastery of GUI concepts 
					using NStimers. I created a short <a href="Projects.htm#proj6" style="color: black;"><u>animation</u></a> demonstrating proficiency with complex 
					graphics concepts rendered at 600 by 800 resolution at 24 FPS. And lastly I programmed 
					a multiclass <a href="Projects.htm#proj7" style="color: black;"><u>user input game</u></a> demonstrating data structures mastery and using 
					the Java Swing libraries.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Professionally I have IT experience working as a <a href="Professional-Experience.htm#work1" style="color:black;"><u>lab assistant</u></a> at the Advanced
					Scientific Computing Lab of Eckerd College from 2012-2015. And I have experience
					in the domestic workplace as an <a href="Professional-Experience.htm#work2" style="color:black;"><u>assistant to an autistic adult</u></a> from 2009-present.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Perhaps most importantly though I posess a strong passion for computer science.
					I enjoy the aspect of the puzzle that working with computers presents. I have 
					learned how to be patient and persistant with them while also being productive. 
					And I crave the sense of accomplishment that finally getting the computer to 
					act as I want it to act provides.</p>
					<p></p>

					website at your leisure. Also you can contact me at <a href="mailto:kk@kylekempton.com" style="color:black;"><u>kk@kylekempton.com.</u></a></p>
