					<h2>Projects:</h2>

					<h3 id="proj1"><u>Research Assistant on Bioinformatics program</u></h3>
					<h4> - September 2014 - Decmber 2014</h4>
					<p></p>
					<p>Done as an independent study under my mentor professor (CS 498). This project involved verifying a 
					previously completed study of GPU calculations on fractal dimensions of biofilm images.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Our goal was to implement a software called BIP (biofilm image processing) on the GPU using C++ and
					CUDA code. The original code for BIP is now only binary and therefore had to be reverse engineered. In its current 
					state this software runs a box counting algorithm to calculate the fractal dimensions of images of biofilms.
					It was my job to verify this code and place it online in a user freindly format.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>* Please Note: This is a project which is still in development at Eckerd College, therefore sample code is not avalible.</p>
					<p></p>

					<h3 id="proj2"><u>Website Proposal for Immunization Initiative</u></h3>
					<h4> - September 2014 - December 2014</h4>
					<p></p>
					<p>Developed as part of a community/school partnership, this website was built for an immunization initiative called 
					PITCH (Pinellas Immunization Team for Community Health) using HTML,CSS and PHP/MySQL queries.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Built according to client specifications, this website is designed primarily for end users as a conduit through 
					which this initiative (PITCH) of the Florida Health Department might communicate with its audience. This website was 
					also designed  to serve as a prototype of a DBMS using PHP/MySQL queries to retrieve school children's immunization 
					records in order to give the department's immunization initiative greater leverage in trying to acquire the funds for the 
					development of the full scale DBMS.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p> * Please Note: The code for this website was given to PITCH in December 2014. They currently do not have it posted online, 
					therefore sample code is not avalible. PITCH's current web presence can be found <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PinellasImmy/" 
					target="_blank" style="color:black;"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
					<p></p>

					<h3 id="proj3"><u>Java Geometry Package</u></h3>
					<h4> - February 2014 - May 2014</h4>
					<p>Developed with a partner this java package was built as an extension to the Java API libraries. Designed to allow programmers
					ease of access to Euclidean geometric functions. Simply by importing our package, using our dot extensions, and providing the prompted
					input, programmers can run calculations on many geometric shapes.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>The package provides functions for the creation and manipulation of both two dimentional and three dimensional shapes.
					Using inheritance from a shape class programmers define the shape by its dimension, number of sides, and vertices in the Eucliden plain.
					Using those definitions programmers are also given access to dot extensions that allow for the rotation, translation and reflection of all shapes.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Sample code provided here: <a href="code-samples/Geometry-sample.zip" style="color:black;"><u>.JAVA files</u></a>     
					<a href="code-samples/Geometry-sample-text.zip" style="color:black;"><u>.TXT files</u></a></p>
					<p></p>

					<h3 id="proj4"><u>Website Proposal for Business District</u></h3>
					<h4> - February 2014 - May 2014</h4>
					<p>Built in a group of three, this website was developed in HTML using CSS files. Developed for the Skyway Marina Business District to
					assist in a productive marketing and advertising campaign in an attempt to reach a wider audience.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>This website was built according to client specifications and on an agreed upon timescale. Constructed to be consumer friendly,
					this website served primarily to inform and attract consumers to the business district area. And further to be a venue through which the websites
					of the individual member businesses might attract traffic. Lastly we created documentation for the publication and maintenance of our 
					website for those who would use the code after us.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p> * Please Note: The code and documentation for this website was given to the Skyway Marina business district in may of 2014. They 
					currently do not have it posted online therefore sample code is not avalible. The Skyway Marina's current web presence can be found 
					<a href="http://skywaymarinadistrict.org/" target="_blank" style="color:black;"><u>here</u></a>.</p>

					<h3 id="proj5"><u>iPhone Application in Objective C for iOS</u></h3>
					<h4> - September 2013 - December 2013 </h4>
					<p>Designed and engineered with a partner, this iPhone application was created to show mastery of GUI design concepts.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Built through Xcode, the application uses NStimers to detect when the user is holding down one of four buttons. Each button starts the
					animation of a character moving through out a room in one of the four cardinal directions by altering sprites on an image view element and 
					shifting a background image view. When the background detects out of bounds coordinates movement is prohibited.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Sample code provided here: <a href="code-samples/iPhone App.zip" style="color:black;"><u>.XCODEPROJ files</u></a></p>
					<p></p>
					
					<h3 id="proj6"><u>Animation</u></h3>
					<h4> - February 2012 - May 2012 </h4>
					<p>This short animation was built in a program called POVRAY, it was designed with a partner to demonstrate proficiency with complex
					graphics concepts.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>This animation lasts sixteen seconds and takes advantage of the difference and union functions building complex final objects from shape primatives. 
					 These final objects are then image and bump map texturized. The clock function is mainpulated to translate the camera and final objects to 
					create an animation. The final product is rendered at a six hundred by eight hundred resolution running at twenty four FPS.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Sample code provided here: <a href="code-samples/Animation-sample.avi" style="color:black;"><u>.AVI file</u></a></p>
					<p></p>

					<h3 id="proj7"><u>Java Swing Game</u></h3>
					<h4> - September 2012 - December 2012 </h4>
					<p>A multiclass user input based game designed to demonstrate mastery of data structures. Created in a group of three this game makes use of
					the Java Swing libraries for its GUI.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Program creates a craft which uses the input controls. When the craft detects collision, movement is prevented. Some coordinates open
					a battle window. These windows contatin buttons allowing players to add and subtract from two different integers. If throughout the game the integer 
					representing health never reaches zero a special congratulatory window is opened, after which the system exits.</p>

					<a href="code-samples/Java-Swing-text-Sample.zip" style="color:black;"><u>.TXT files</u></a></p>
